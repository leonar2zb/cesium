// Next.js environment variables are accessed via process.env and are typed in next-env.d.ts

// For Next.js environment variables, you can declare them like this if needed:
declare namespace NodeJS {
  interface ProcessEnv {
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: string;
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PIXEL_URL: string;
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PIXEL_URL1: string;
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PIXEL_URL2: string;
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PIXEL_URL3: string;
    // Add other environment variables as needed
  }
